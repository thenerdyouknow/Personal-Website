            <dd><strong>Polling Application Using Secure Multiparty Computation:(In Progress)</strong><br>
                Building a polling application which will allow users to create and host polls, allow people to vote on those polls, but the votes are obscured using Shamir Secret Sharing. Everyone involved in the process see the result of the poll but none of the intermediate information, not even the servers storing the votes. This is a way to securely compute a function(in this case addition), without leaking any confidential information.<br>
                <br>

                <strong>Chess Position Predictor:</strong><br>
                Built a Deep Learning model that, given two positions, predicts which position is better. Modeled after the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.09667.pdf">DeepChess</a>. Achieved 90% training accuracy and 85% validation accuracy.<br>
                <br>

                <strong>Upto Triple Error Correcting Codes in ATMega328:</strong><br>
                Implemented upto Triple ECCs on a stock ATMega328 microcontroller using a variation of the Peterson-Gorenstein-Zierler algorithm(for single and double ECC) and Hamming(for single ECC) using Arduino based on C and C++. Optimized the implementation to run on less than half the Flash(32k bytes) and SRAM(2k bytes) memory available.<br>
                <br>

                <strong>Traffic Signal Recognition/American Sign Language Detection:</strong><br>
                Combined new found Machine Learning knowledge acquired in Introduction to Machine Learning with skill in Python to build a model that detected all classes of traffic signals using Keras. This was done using a small dataset of just 3000 images split across 60-ish classes. Achieved roughly 96% training, 98% validation, and 96% testing accuracy on two different datasets.<br>
                <br>
                To gain experience with other backends, followed up previous model with another model built using PyTorch to detect American Sign Language. Achieved 90+ training, testing, and validation accuracies for this model as well.<br>
                <br>

                <strong>FreeCodeCamp Front-End Certification :</strong><br>
                Finished the entire front end certification in under two months.
                Built over ten projects involving a Tic Tac Toe game against a computer
                and a Simon Game, as a part of the certification over the span of two
                weeks. These are available on my CodePen profile.<br>

                <strong>Book Buying/Selling Platform :</strong><br>
                Built a book buying and selling platform using Django as a base for an
                Advanced Programming course in college.<br><br>

                 <strong>Beowulf Cluster :</strong><br>
                Built a Beowulf Cluster out of old, discarded laptops to test the need for one at my University.
